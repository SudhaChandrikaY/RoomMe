## 💡 Overview

RoomMe is a lightweight web application that helps people find compatible roommates based on lifestyle preferences **and location**. 

With just a few questions, RoomMe filters and ranks potential roommates, saving users time, frustration, and awkward mismatches. This is our minimal viable product (MVP) for the World’s Largest Hackathon — and it lays the foundation for a full-fledged roommate matching service.

## 🗝️ The Problem

Finding a roommate is more than just splitting rent — it’s about finding someone whose daily habits and lifestyle actually align with yours.

**Common challenges:**
- **Mismatched habits:** Early risers living with night owls, or clean freaks sharing with messy housemates.
- **Poor communication:** Awkward conflicts about pets, noise levels, or guests.
- **Wasted time:** Endless scrolling through generic listings that don’t filter for compatibility.
- **Location gaps:** Listing sites often match people who live too far apart, leading to commuting headaches or awkward moves.

These mismatches can cause stress, conflicts, and even force people to break leases early.

## ✅ How RoomMe Solves It

RoomMe tackles these pain points in three simple steps:

1. **Preference Form:** Users quickly fill out their name, age, preferred noise level, cleanliness, pet preference, and city.
2. **Smart Filtering:** The app filters out incompatible matches based on city — because being in the same area is the bare minimum!
3. **Compatibility Ranking:** Matches are scored (0–3) based on how many lifestyle preferences align. Users see the best matches first.

No more surprises. No more mismatched expectations. Just clear, better living from day one.
